                        üëãüèª 	Welcome and thanks for stopping by! I love working with technology! It‚Äôs fun, inspiring, frustrating, and exuberating all at one time. I have always been an artist and creator at heart, so one of the things I love most about programming is the ability to create something that can help or inspire some one. 
                        <br />
	                    I am a Software Engineer with over a decade of customer service and retail management experience. I have 8 years of experience working with cross-functional teams, mentoring and training, creative problem solving, root-cause analysis, and data analysis.  I also have a strong interest in art, meaning I create projects with a strong design aesthetic in mind. I recently graduated from a Software Engineer Immersive facilitated by General Assembly and sponsored by Adobe Digital Academy Scholar Program. I am currently attending WGU for B.S. in Software Engineering as well as learning new concepts in blockchain and web3 development.
                        <br />
                        I am currently seeking a remote full-time, internship, or apprenticeship role in tech. I am always looking to make new connections so feel free to send me a message!
